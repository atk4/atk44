Presence of the "Hello World" component in the standard distribution is just us saying "The best way
to create a Hello World app is around a Helloworld component".

Basic Usage
===========

To add a "Hello, World" message::

    Helloworld::addTo($app);

There are no additional features on this component, it is intentionally left simple. For a more
sophisticated "Hello, World" implementation look into Hello World add-on.
